# Grafana

## What is Grafana?

Grafana is an **open-source observability and visualization platform**.
It lets you **query, visualise, alert, and explore** metrics, logs, and traces from multiple data sources.

Originally created by Torkel Ödegaard, Grafana has grown into a **CNCF incubating project** and is now the **de facto dashboarding tool** in cloud-native monitoring stacks.

If Prometheus is the “brain” of monitoring (data collection & querying), Grafana is the **eyes** (dashboards & visualisations).



## Why Do We Need Grafana?

Modern systems generate **huge amounts of telemetry data**:

* **Metrics** (from Prometheus, InfluxDB, Graphite, etc.)
* **Logs** (from Loki, Elasticsearch, Splunk, etc.)
* **Traces** (from Jaeger, Tempo, Zipkin, etc.)

Without **visualisation**, raw metrics are hard to interpret.
Grafana solves this by:

* Turning metrics into **interactive dashboards**
* Providing **alerting** when thresholds are crossed
* Enabling **multi-source observability** (metrics + logs + traces in one UI)

Grafana = **single pane of glass for observability**.



## How Grafana Works

Grafana itself does **not collect data**. Instead, it:

1. Connects to **data sources** (Prometheus, Loki, Elasticsearch, etc.)
2. Executes queries against them
3. Renders results in **panels** (graphs, gauges, tables, heatmaps, etc.)
4. Organises panels into **dashboards**
5. Provides **alerting & notifications** based on panel queries

## Data Flow: From Metrics → Grafana → User

```mermaid

    participant DS as Data Source (Prometheus, Loki, etc.)
    participant G as Grafana
    participant User as User (SRE/DevOps)

    User->>G: Request dashboard
    G->>DS: Query metrics/logs/traces
    DS-->>G: Return results
    G-->>User: Render panels
    G->>User: Send alerts (if configured)
```



## Example Grafana Panels

Grafana supports **many visualisation types**:

* **Time series graph** → CPU usage over time
* **Gauge / SingleStat** → current memory usage
* **Heatmap** → latency distribution
* **Table** → list of failing pods
* **Pie chart** → % of requests per region

Panels can be grouped into **dashboards** (e.g., “Kubernetes Cluster Health”).



## Common Data Sources

Grafana supports **dozens of backends**. Most common:

| Type          | Example                                       | Purpose                 |
| - |  | -- |
| **Metrics**   | Prometheus, InfluxDB, Graphite                | Time-series metrics     |
| **Logs**      | Loki, Elasticsearch, Splunk                   | Centralised logging     |
| **Traces**    | Tempo, Jaeger, Zipkin                         | Distributed tracing     |
| **Databases** | MySQL, PostgreSQL                             | Custom queries          |
| **Cloud**     | AWS CloudWatch, GCP Monitoring, Azure Monitor | Cloud-native monitoring |

Grafana turns it into a **multi-source observability platform**.



## Alerting in Grafana

Grafana provides a **unified alerting system** (since v8):

* **Create alerts** directly from panels.
* Alerts are evaluated on the **Grafana server**.
* Notifications are sent via **channels**:

  * Slack
  * Email
  * PagerDuty
  * Microsoft Teams
  * Webhooks

### Example Alert Flow

1. Define a threshold (e.g., CPU usage > 80%).
2. Grafana runs the query periodically.
3. If condition matches, an **alert fires**.
4. Notification goes to configured channel.



## Installing Grafana

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
```

* UI: `http://localhost:3000`
* Default credentials: `admin/admin`

### Kubernetes (Helm)

```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm install grafana grafana/grafana
```



## Security Best Practices

* Always set **admin password** (default is insecure).
* Enable **TLS** if exposed publicly.
* Use **OAuth/SAML/LDAP** for authentication.
* Use **folders & permissions** to restrict dashboard access.
* Enable **audit logs** for compliance.



## Key Strengths of Grafana

* **Multi-data-source** (metrics, logs, traces, SQL, cloud).
* **Rich visualisations** (100+ panel types, plugins).
* **Pre-built dashboards** (Grafana.com library).
* **Fast querying & exploration** (great with Prometheus).
* **Unified alerting** with many integrations.
* **Extensible** (plugins for panels, datasources, apps).



## Limitations & Watch Outs

* **No storage** → relies on external data sources.
* **Query-heavy dashboards** → can overload Prometheus/DB.
* **High availability setup** requires external DB (MySQL/Postgres).
* **User management** is limited in OSS (Grafana Enterprise adds RBAC, reporting).



## Grafana in the Observability Stack

```mermaid

    subgraph Metrics
        P[Prometheus]
        N[node_exporter]
        C[cAdvisor]
    end

    subgraph Logs
        L[Loki]
    end

    subgraph Traces
        T[Tempo]
    end

    subgraph Grafana["Grafana Dashboards"]
        G["Dashboards + Alerts"]
    end

    P --> G
    L --> G
    T --> G
```

Grafana = **central observability frontend** for metrics, logs, and traces.



## Grafana Cheat Sheet

### Core Concepts

| Term             | Meaning                                                 |
| - | - |
| **Data source**  | External system providing data (Prometheus, Loki, etc.) |
| **Panel**        | Single visualisation (graph, table, etc.)               |
| **Dashboard**    | Collection of panels                                    |
| **Alert**        | Rule based on a query, triggers notification            |
| **Organisation** | Multi-tenant separation in Grafana                      |
| **Folder**       | Logical grouping of dashboards                          |



### Common Use Cases

* **System monitoring** (CPU, memory, disk usage).
* **Kubernetes monitoring** (pods, nodes, namespaces).
* **Business metrics** (orders per minute, revenue trends).
* **Application performance monitoring (APM)**.
* **Log exploration** (with Loki/Elasticsearch).



## Final Takeaway

Grafana is:

* The **visualisation + alerting layer** of modern monitoring stacks.
* **Datasource-agnostic** (works with metrics, logs, traces, SQL).
* **Essential** for Kubernetes, microservices, and cloud-native setups.

Think of Grafana as the **dashboard and control room** where DevOps, SREs, and engineers get their insights.
