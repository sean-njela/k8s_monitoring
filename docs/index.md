# 🚀 Monitoring with Prometheus — A Personal Project

Welcome to my **Prometheus documentation project** — a personal initiative to showcase deep expertise in **monitoring, observability, and cloud-native systems**.  

This site is structured as a **complete guide to Prometheus**, blending fundamentals, hands-on examples, best practices, and advanced topics.  
It is designed for **engineers, SREs, and learners** who want to understand Prometheus from **zero to production-ready scale**.  

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

- ✅ Demonstrate **expert knowledge** in Prometheus, observability, and the monitoring ecosystem.  
- 📚 Provide a **world-class learning resource** that assumes no prior knowledge.  
- 🧑‍💼 Serve as a **portfolio piece** highlighting my technical writing, system design, and DevOps skills.

## 🧭 Quick Overview of Prometheus

Prometheus is an **open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit** that:  
- 🔧 Collects metrics from applications, systems, and services.  
- 📊 Stores them in a purpose-built **time-series database (TSDB)**.  
- 🔍 Provides a powerful query language (**PromQL**) for analysis.  
- 🔔 Integrates with **Alertmanager** for notifications.  
- ⚡ Pairs with **Grafana** for visualization.  

---

## ⚡ Getting Started

Jump into the **[Quick Start](0-quickstart/1-getting-started.md)** guide to see Prometheus in action:
- Install and run Prometheus.  
- Scrape your first target.  
- Query data using PromQL.  
- Visualize metrics in Grafana.  
- Trigger a simple alert.

## 📐 Architecture & Components

This project explains Prometheus from the ground up:

- **Core Concepts** → Targets, exporters, metrics, labels.  
- **Prometheus Server** → Scraping, TSDB, querying.  
- **Alertmanager** → Alerts and routing.  
- **Grafana** → Visualization.  
- **Scaling** → Thanos, Cortex, federation, long-term storage.  

Explore diagrams and workflows in **[Architecture](1-architecture/0-overview.md)**.

## 📚 Documentation Roadmap

The site is organized as a **step-by-step progression**:

* **Quick Start** → Setup, scrape your first metrics, build intuition.  
* **Architecture** → Understand internals and ecosystem.  
* **PromQL & Features** → Querying, alerting, exporters.  
* **Scaling & Best Practices** → Long-term storage, high-cardinality handling.  
* **About Me** → My background, expertise, and contact.

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

Prometheus is used widely for:  

* 🖥️ **System Monitoring** → CPU, memory, disk metrics.  
* 📦 **Kubernetes Monitoring** → Nodes, pods, cluster health.  
* 🛠️ **Application Monitoring** → API traffic, error rates, latency.  
* 🔔 **Alerting** → Incident detection, anomaly detection.  

These examples are included as practical demos in this documentation.
